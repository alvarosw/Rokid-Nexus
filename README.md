Rokid Nexus is a plugin platform for Rokid AR glasses: one permanent hub lives
on the glasses and renders everything; all features ship as ordinary Android
APKs on the phone. Nothing is ever installed on the glasses again.

Plugins stay isolated in their own processes, appear only after explicit user
approval, and draw on the HUD through declarative surfaces — cards, synced
timed lines, media decks, real images, and compiled interactive Ink pages. They
can also speak, listen, and see:
speech in and out, and the glasses camera, are platform capabilities the wearer
grants one at a time and can take back.

## Plugins

| Plugin | What it puts on the HUD |
|---|---|
| **[Assistant](plugins/assistant/)** | Hold the touchpad and ask out loud: your words appear as you speak them, then the answer arrives on the band, in your ear, or as a native Ink page with charts and interactive controls — and it can look through the glasses camera to tell you what you are seeing. Ask it to remind you, set a timer, or take a note, and it does: the phone rings at the hour and the glasses raise it. It can also add, read, and safely delete phone-calendar events. Runs on your own ChatGPT plan, or any AI provider you bring a key for — OpenAI, OpenRouter, MiniMax, DeepSeek, GLM, Hermes, or your own server |
| **[Relay](plugins/relay/)** | Phone messages as a band over whatever you were looking at, answered out loud or typed from the phone — plus an inbox for the ones you let go |
| **[Navigation](plugins/nav/)** | The route Google Maps or Citymapper is guiding you on, kept on the glasses as one live activity: the next turn and its distance, or the walk to the stop, the line to board and the stops left |
| **[Lens](plugins/lens/)** | Google-Lens-style live translation: the glasses camera streams to the phone, ML Kit OCR + translation run there (offline), translated overlays come back in real time — plus a freeze mode for full-resolution stills |
| **[Feeds](plugin-feeds/)** | Bluesky and X timelines — browse posts, open threads, and view the actual photos full-screen |
| **[Transit](plugins/transit/)** | Nearby stops and live departures (Transitous/MOTIS), with favourites |
| **[Lyrics](plugins/lyrics/)** | Time-synced lyrics for whatever is playing on the phone, from Spotify/Musixmatch/Netease/LrcLib |
| **[Media Deck](plugins/media/)** | Universal now-playing surface with album art and transport controls |
| **[Photos Sync](plugins/photosync/)** | Not a HUD plugin: copies the photos and videos you shoot on the glasses into the phone gallery by itself, and gives you the switches for it |
| **[Wireless ADB](plugins/wireless-adb/)** | Enables Android's real wireless debugging service and creates a short-lived pairing command, so a trusted computer can connect to the glasses over the LAN without a cable or Settings automation |
| **[Tasker](plugins/tasker/)** | Your named Tasker tasks on the HUD — swipe, tap, and the phone runs the automation. The glasses are the remote, Tasker does the work |
| **[Sample](plugins/sample/)** | Minimal copyable reference plugin |

And ten that are not in this repository at all, written by four other authors
against the same SDK and listed in the same Store:

| Plugin | Author | What it puts on the HUD |
|---|---|---|
| **[Lume](https://github.com/beyondlevi/lume-nexus)** | beyondlevi | A wearable speed reader: text arrives one word at a time at a fixed point, 150–700 wpm, with long words and sentence endings held a little longer. Import a PDF or a text file on the phone, read hands-free with the R08 ring |
| **[Agenda](https://github.com/beyondlevi/rokid-agenda-nexus)** | beyondlevi | The calendars your phone already syncs: what is next first, then the event's participants and description |
| **[News](https://github.com/beyondlevi/news-nexus)** | beyondlevi | RSS and Atom feeds: sources with unread counts, headlines newest first, articles paged |
| **[Tuya Smart Home](https://github.com/beyondlevi/rokid-tuya-nexus)** | beyondlevi | Your Tuya / Smart Life homes, rooms and devices — pick one and act on it |
| **[Shopping List](https://github.com/beyondlevi/nexus-shoplist)** | Volund | Your list on the HUD, ticked off with the ring, while you add to it on the phone — or paste a whole list and have every line become an item |
| **[Home Assistant](https://github.com/azhilin246/rokid-nexus-home-assistant)** | Zhilin | Configurable Home Assistant pages; the selected tile runs its action |
| **[OTPs](https://github.com/azhilin246/rokid-nexus-otps)** | Zhilin | One-time codes extracted from notifications, after explicit Android approval, as timed alerts plus a short history |
| **[Taxi Plate](https://github.com/azhilin246/rokid-nexus-taxi-plate)** | Zhilin | The active ride from supported taxi apps, with pickup or trip timing |
| **[RokidHub · Codex](https://github.com/lavAzza2/rokidhub-codex)** | Azat Akhmetshin | Coding tasks by voice, routed through RokidHub to Codex on your own machine |
| **[RokidHub · Yandex](https://github.com/lavAzza2/rokidhub-nexus-yandex)** | Azat Akhmetshin | Yandex Smart Home by voice, answered on the HUD and aloud |

They install and run exactly like the ones above, under the same grants and the
same identity checks. Nothing in the platform is reserved for first-party code.

All of them install from the in-app **Nexus Store**, backed by the public
[RokidBrew-Registry](https://github.com/Anezium/RokidBrew-Registry) feed with
SHA-256 and signer pinning enforced before every install, and show update
badges when a newer release is published.

The phone hub also controls software that is already installed on the glasses.
**Glasses apps** lists and opens launchable native APKs; **Keyboard & remote**
provides previous/next/select/back navigation and sends transient keyboard
deltas into the focused glasses editor, a plugin's own text field included; when
a plugin opens a field, the screen comes forward by itself and leaves once the
field is done. Password fields are marked sensitive,
the phone window becomes secure, and Nexus never mirrors the editor's existing
text. These are trusted hub-to-hub controls, not plugin capabilities, and they
do not install native APKs.

## Setup — a phone is all you need

1. Install the Nexus phone app from this repository's
   [releases](https://github.com/Anezium/Rokid-Nexus/releases).
2. Follow the onboarding: seven in-context steps, including pushing the
   glasses app over the Rokid link — no cable, no PC.
3. On the glasses, enable the accessibility service when asked. Nexus
   bootstraps the rest of its glasses-side setup by itself.
4. Install your first plugin from the Store.

Both apps keep themselves current afterwards: the phone updates from GitHub
releases, the glasses update over the Rokid link, plugins update through the
Store.

Trust model: any APK may request bus access, but capabilities (`surfaces`,
`ink_surface`, `http_proxy`, `microphone`, `stt`, `tts`, `camera`, `mediasync`,
`assistant`, `wireless_debugging`) are granted per
plugin by the user, keyed to package + plugin id + signing certificate. Installation alone never grants
anything. The phone and glasses hubs also authenticate their SPP connection with
an installation pairing key enrolled through the authorized Hi Rokid CXR link;
each SPP frame has integrity and replay protection. The key is bound to the
Hi Rokid-authorized CXR session, using its serial number, device name, or a single
current-session fallback, and is reoffered on each CXR connection. With several
glasses, the key follows the currently CXR-connected pair. Successful SPP
handshakes save an address-to-CXR-identity binding for offline reconnects; absent
a binding, the last identity is used. A key mismatch fails closed without rotating
the key. An unreadable phone key can recover through a ready authorized CXR
session; offline reconnects never generate or replace keys. The existing
connection notification shows pairing recovery or an unavailable key, and a
ready CXR identity wakes the SPP reconnect backoff immediately. Until enrollment and authentication,
binary and large messages (including media sync and Wireless ADB data-plane
traffic) return `NO_DATA_PLANE`. Both hubs must support this transport version;
legacy peers retain only the existing CXR control path.
Developer mode adds package, signer, protocol, and route diagnostics
plus a live bus inspector.

## Build a plugin

A plugin is a headless phone APK against the published SDK:

```kotlin
repositories { maven("https://jitpack.io") }

dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.Anezium.Rokid-Nexus:bus-client:sdk-v0.21.0")
}
```

Start with [plugins/AGENTS.md](plugins/AGENTS.md) — the complete,
self-contained plugin contract — then [docs/PLUGIN_SDK.md](docs/PLUGIN_SDK.md)
(SDK reference) and [docs/PLUGINS.md](docs/PLUGINS.md) (structure + design
kit). [plugins/sample](plugins/sample/) is the canonical template. Publishing
is F-Droid-like: host the APK on your own releases, PR a manifest to the
registry ([plugins/README.md](plugins/README.md)).

## Repository layout

- `shared`: wire envelopes, paths, descriptors, capabilities, and route rules.
- `bus-client`: the public Android SDK — `NexusPluginService`, lifecycle
  callbacks, typed card/timed-lines/media/image surfaces, notice bands and
  activities, compiled Ink sessions, speech in and out, the NexusUi design kit,
  and explicit hub targeting.
- `ink-engine`: the bounded `.ink` compiler, data-binding engine, revisioned
  render document/patch codec, and strict compatibility limits shared by both
  hubs and the public SDK.
- `phone-hub`: discovery, consent, identity enforcement, the Nexus Store, app
  self-update, trusted native-app/keyboard controls, and the Rokid link.
- `glasses-hub`: the single HUD renderer/launcher anchor, the camera platform,
  native Ink renderer, Nexus IME/navigation bridge, and no-PC self-arm onboarding.
- `plugins/` and `plugin-feeds/`: the plugin APKs, one folder per plugin with
  its README and CHANGELOG.
- `phone-client-probe` and `glasses-client-probe`: validation modules.

## Local build

Use JDK 17 and the checked-in Gradle wrapper:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat test lintDebug assembleDebug
.\gradlew.bat :shared:publishToMavenLocal :bus-client:publishToMavenLocal '-PversionName=0.1.0-SNAPSHOT'
.\gradlew.bat :plugin-sample:assembleDebug '-PusePublishedSdk=true' '-PversionName=0.1.0-SNAPSHOT'
```

The local `CxrGlobal` composite is used only when its sibling directory exists.
SDK publication and the published-coordinate sample build do not require it.
