/**
 * Pushes the phone's charge to the glasses' status badge.
 *
 * `ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED` is sticky and chatty — it fires on every percent and
 * on every plug event — so this deduplicates on the value rather than the
 * broadcast. A phone sitting at 47% can emit the intent repeatedly without ever
 * putting a frame on the wire.
 *
 * It also resends on demand, because the badge's state lives on the glasses and
 * dies with their hub. Link-up and the glasses' own capability announcement are
 * both wired to [resend]; without that, a wearer who rebooted their glasses
 * would see no badge until the phone happened to cross a percent.
 *
 * The wearer's toggle ([PhoneBatteryBadgeStore]) gates the *sending*, and
 * turning it off transmits an explicit hidden state rather than going silent:
 * readings never expire glasses-side, so silence would leave the last
 * percentage on the HUD forever. The battery keeps being tracked while
 * disabled, which is what lets re-enabling show a current number immediately.
 *
 * While the glasses report their display off ([isScreenOn] false) nothing is sent: the badge shows
 * outside the home, so it keys on the display, not on the home. Readings keep being tracked, and
 * the display coming back on is wired to [resend], which sends the current reading or hidden state.
