/**
 * The shared motion vocabulary for the glasses HUD.
 *
 * Three rules hold the whole thing together, and they are the reason this is a
 * layer rather than an `animate()` call sprinkled into each renderer:
 *
 *  1. **Motion is glasses-local.** The phone sends state, never frames. The
 *     transport is far too slow to drive a 280 ms morph over the wire, so a
 *     renderer receives "this changed" and decides the motion itself.
 *  2. **New state always wins, and it resumes from where the eye is.** An
 *     update landing mid-animation retargets the running animation from its
 *     current value. Nothing ever snaps back to a start value; that read is
 *     what makes a HUD look broken rather than alive.
 *  3. **Motion means something happened.** These helpers exist for state
 *     changes, not decoration. On additive AR optics a moving element sits in
 *     the wearer's field of view while they are walking, so an idle loop is not
 *     a flourish, it is a distraction with a thermal bill.
