/**
 * The tethered phone's charge in the Rokid launcher's own status row, sitting
 * with the glasses' clock and weather.
 *
 * ## Why it is not a pin
 *
 * A pin is a panel the wearer reads and dismisses; this is an indicator they
 * glance past. It is also *launcher-scoped by design*, which no other HUD tier
 * is: the ROM's own indicators vanish the moment an app opens, and a battery
 * chip that behaved differently would read as ours intruding rather than as
 * one more status icon.
 *
 * ## Coexisting with R08AccessBridge's ring chip
 *
 * The bridge draws its own ring chip into this row, mid-right (fallback slot
 * `[276..375]` measured 2026-07-28), and keeps doing so — overlays are mutually
 * invisible, in `getWindows()` and in the node tree alike, so the two chips
 * coexist by *side*, not by seeing each other. Ours anchors left beside the
 * weather and grows rightward; phone glyph plus a three-digit label peaks
 * ~65px wide, ending near x=182, a ~94px margin from the bridge's slot. A ring
 * migration into this renderer was built and reverted: once the sides diverge,
 * the coupling bought nothing. If this row ever grows more chips, mind that
 * boundary before minding anything else.
 *
 * Placement itself is in [StatusBadgeGeometry] (left-pinned beside the clock
 * and weather, growing rightward — the reasoning for the side is there) and
 * [StatusBadgeReserve] (adapts to the left cluster's observed capacity, never
 * to its moment-to-moment content).
 *
 * ## What is read from the ROM, and why neither read can race
 *
 * One tree walk answers the badge questions and identifies the top package,
 * all from the same node so they cannot disagree.
 *
 * **Is the launcher on top** — the only genuinely live question, and an event is
 * exactly what answers it.
 *
 * **The row's vertical centre**, from `status_power_iv`. Chosen over the
 * status-bar container because the container spans y 306..400 while the icons sit
 * at 365 — its centre is 12px wrong — and over `status_wifi_iv` because the
 * battery is the one indicator always present. A container's position does not
 * change when its contents do, so a late read is not a wrong read.
 *
 * **How far right the clock-and-weather cluster reaches**, folded into
 * [StatusBadgeReserve]. This is the capacity observation, and it is safe for the
 * one structural reason that the reserve never shrinks: it can only push the
 * badges further from the ROM's text. A stale reading leaves them where they
 * are; it can never walk them underneath something.
 *
 * If the ROM renames these ids, the chip disappears rather than guesses: a row
 * it cannot find is a row it must not draw into — the same status bar relocates
 * wholesale between layouts (top third on the home, bottom edge in the
 * teleprompter), so there is no constant that is safe to fall back to.
