# Nexus plugins

Every Rokid Nexus plugin is a **headless phone APK**: it installs like an app,
has no launcher icon, renders its settings with the shared NexusUi kit, and
lives entirely inside Nexus — launched from the glasses launcher, configured
from the phone hub, removable from its own settings screen. How to build one
is documented in [docs/PLUGINS.md](../docs/PLUGINS.md) (structure + design
kit) and [docs/PLUGIN_SDK.md](../docs/PLUGIN_SDK.md) (SDK reference).

Each plugin owns one folder here with its module sources, a `README.md`
explaining what it does and how it is built, and a `CHANGELOG.md` tracking its
releases. The Gradle project names keep the historical `:plugin-<id>` form
(mapped in `settings.gradle.kts`).

## Catalogue

| Plugin | Id | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [Assistant](assistant/) | `assistant` | Voice questions answered on the band, aloud, or as generated native Ink pages, with camera vision, reminders, notes, and phone-calendar create/list/delete tools |
| [Relay](relay/) | `relay` | Phone notifications on the HUD, answered by voice, with an inbox for the rest |
| [Navigation](nav/) | `nav` | Google Maps and Citymapper guidance kept on the glasses as one live activity |
| [Feeds](../plugin-feeds/) | `feeds` | Bluesky and X timelines on the HUD |
| [Lens](lens/) | `lens` | Live and frozen camera OCR with phone-side translation |
| [Transit](transit/) | `transit` | Nearby stops, departures, and favourites |
| [Lyrics](lyrics/) | `lyrics` | Live synced lyrics for whatever is playing |
| [Media Deck](media/) | `media` | Universal now-playing surface with transport controls |
| [Photos Sync](photosync/) | `photosync` | Copies glasses captures into the phone gallery on their own |
| [Wireless ADB](wireless-adb/) | `wirelessadb` | Enables and pairs the glasses' real ADB-over-Wi-Fi transport under an explicit high-risk grant |
| [Tasker](tasker/) | `tasker` | Lists named Tasker tasks on the HUD and runs the selected automation on the phone |
| [Sample](sample/) | `hello` | Minimal copyable reference plugin |

Feeds lives at the repository root as `plugin-feeds/`; everything else about
it follows the same layout and rules.

## Releases

Plugins release from this repository as GitHub releases with **namespaced
tags**, one stream per plugin, separate from the app's `v*` releases:

- Tag `lyrics-v1.1.0` → release `Lyrics 1.1.0` carrying
  `lyrics-phone-release.apk`, created with `--latest=false` so the app's
  `releases/latest` pointer is never disturbed.
- The release notes are the matching section of the plugin's `CHANGELOG.md`.
- The RokidBrew registry ingests the release (`--kind nexus-plugin`) and the
  Nexus Store serves it from `dist/nexus-plugins.v1.json`.
- Before installing, the phone verifies the downloaded APK against the
  registry entry's `sha256` and pins the signing certificate
  (`signerSha256`); a mismatch aborts the install.
- The phone home screen checks the registry for newer versions of installed
  plugins (throttled) and shows an `UPDATE` badge per plugin plus an update
  count on the Store row.

Before pushing a plugin tag, set that module's `versionName` and add the
matching `## <version>` changelog section; release CI rejects either mismatch.
