# Changelog — Sample

## 1.0.4

- Demonstrate activity extras with SDK 0.21.0 and Nexus hubs 1.5.0: a
  scripted route, one step per `DEMO_ACTIVITY` intent sent over adb, shows the
  fitted panel, a line badge, a measure beside the value, a track of stops and
  an urgent "get off" update. On older hubs the same steps show without the
  extras.

## 1.0.3

- Demonstrate background microphone capture with SDK 0.18.0 and Nexus hubs
  1.4.10: acquire audio, detach the surface, and resume or stop from the hub.
- Put Start background mic first on the Ink page.
- Keep the microphone pin compact and expire it within five seconds of a crash
  or stalled audio stream; normal stops hide it immediately.

## 1.0.2 — unreleased

- Add the background microphone reference flow with a non-waking pin, detached
  surface, resume control, and explicit lease release.
- Add the public Ink Surface reference: capability detection, authored page,
  chart, tap action, data patch, typed callbacks, and card fallback.
- Add the speech-to-text dictation surface, retry flow, and plugin metadata.

## 1.0.0 — unreleased

- Canonical headless template with image and card surfaces, input handling,
  and a kit-based settings screen.
