# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- OsmAnd and OsmAnd+: the turn in words, its distance, the street and the
  arrival time, with the close-turn warning. Checked on a phone and glasses.
- Yandex Maps: driving distance, street and arrival time, in English or
  Russian. Checked on a phone and glasses, the distance counting down.
- Organic Maps: distance and street, updated while the app is in the
  background. Checked on a phone and glasses. Its arrows are pictures, so the
  glyph stays neutral.
- maps.me is read too, but maps.me itself does not keep guiding in the
  background on Android 11 and later: in picture-in-picture it posts nothing,
  and without it the distance freezes because Android denies its navigation
  service the location. Organic Maps, built from the same code, works.
- Each new app has its own switch.

## 0.1.1

- Korean: Citymapper GO and Google Maps public transport are read in Korean
  (walk, wait, board, stops left, get off soon, arrival), so Navigation works
  in South Korea, where Google Maps has no turn-by-turn. Korean times keep
  their 오전/오후. Built from the apps' own Korean strings; not yet checked on a
  real trip in Korea.

## 0.1.0

- First release: Google Maps turn-by-turn and public transport, and
  Citymapper GO, as one live activity on the glasses, read from their
  notifications. A new step flares; a turn a few metres away or the stop to get
  off at beats once. Needs both Nexus hubs 1.5.0.
- Opening Navigation on the glasses shows the whole current instruction, or
  how to start one.
- A main switch and one switch per app, so Google Maps or Citymapper can be
  kept off the glasses without uninstalling anything.
