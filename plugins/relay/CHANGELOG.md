# Changelog

## 1.3.0

- **Live grid tile** (optional `widget_tile` capability, all seven tile sizes):
  the inbox's conversations with sender, app, newest message, age and initials
  under an "N new" summary, republished as messages arrive, are removed or are
  answered. The inbox is read for the tile only while the hub's tile lease is
  active. Conversations Android redacted never appear on it, and the hide
  switches hide the message text there too.
- The layout editor previews the tile with sample conversations until a real
  one is published.
- **One bus registration.** The notice band now talks through the plugin
  service's own connection instead of opening a second one under the same id,
  so a band, the inbox and the tile lease can overlap without the hub losing
  track of Relay.

## 1.2.4

- **Switch to typing mid-dictation.** About a second after dictation starts, a
  *Type* chip appears; tapping it stops the microphone and opens a text field.
  The arriving band keeps its single Reply chip, so long threads still page.
- **Your reply is typed inside the notice.** With Nexus 1.4.13 the text appears
  live under the message, like an inline reply on an Android notification, and
  the phone keyboard opens by itself (or from a notification) and closes when
  you send. On an older hub, Type opens the separate field as before.

Update both Nexus hubs to **1.4.13** for the inline reply and the phone
keyboard.

## 1.2.3

- **Reply stays available after a brief SPP interruption.** The rebuilt SDK
  preserves the live notice's callbacks while CXR remains connected and SPP
  reconnects. Reply can then open dictation or typing for the same question.

- **Countdown labels preserve the current question.** Sending-countdown updates
  use SDK 0.19.0's `rearm = false` notice patch, so an answer already in transit
  remains attached to the same question. This requires a phone hub advertising
  `noticeInteractionVersion: 1` and matching notice-v5 phone/glasses hubs.
  Rebuilding Relay against the new SDK does not upgrade the hubs: on an older
  phone hub the patch returns `CAPABILITY_NOT_AVAILABLE`, the "Sending Ns"
  label stops updating, and the existing send countdown still proceeds.

Update both Nexus hubs to **1.4.11** before installing this Relay update.

## 1.2.2

- **Reply by typing.** A new switch, off by default: Reply opens a text field
  on the glasses instead of listening. Type on a keyboard paired to the glasses,
  or from Nexus's Keyboard & remote screen on the phone, and Enter sends the
  reply through the same confirm-and-send steps as a spoken one. A message
  arriving while you are mid-reply now waits its turn instead of replacing what
  you were answering, and the band no longer times out while you dictate or
  type. Needs Rokid Nexus 1.4.6; on an older hub the switch falls back to
  dictation. Thanks to ruruw.

## 1.2.1

- **The glasses can name who messaged without showing what.** Two new switches:
  *Hide message text on the glasses* keeps the band to the sender and a Show chip
  — tap it when the moment is right, and Reply is still one tap away — and *Hide
  previews in the inbox* keeps the list to names; opening a conversation still
  reads it. Read-aloud names the sender only while the band is hidden.
- **Message display time is now a number you type.** Two to 45 seconds, 3 by
  default, with a separate *Longer for long messages* switch that adds reading
  time per character. Existing settings carry over: Auto becomes 3 seconds with
  scaling on, a fixed value stays fixed.

## 1.2.0

- **Inbox conversations now open as full-screen reader documents.** Messages
  wrap as prose and scroll in the native glasses renderer, while tapping still
  starts a reply and Back still returns to the Messages list.
- **An open conversation now updates as new messages arrive.** Relay refreshes
  a reader in place while preserving its scroll position, without interrupting
  dictation, reply review, or sending.

## 1.1.4

- **After a reply is sent, the inbox comes back a bit sooner.** The "Sent"
  screen used to hand you back to the list after 1.2 seconds — which turned
  out to be the exact moment most people tap Back, so the tap landed on a
  list they had not seen yet and threw them out of Relay entirely. The
  hand-back now happens at 0.85 seconds: still enough to read "Sent", but
  the switch is over before your thumb gets there.

## 1.1.3

- **Messages Android hides can now come through.** Since Android 15, the system
  blanks out any notification it reads as carrying a code — and it reads far
  more than real codes that way, so an ordinary message with a few digits in it
  arrived on the glasses as "Sensitive notification content hidden". The only
  exemption Android grants is to an app registered as a device's companion,
  which is exactly what Relay is, so a new **Show messages Android hides** entry
  under Access offers to register it with your glasses. It is off until you ask
  for it, and Android's own dialog tells you what registering covers before
  anything happens.
- The registration is worth having on its own: it also lets Relay keep running
  when the system would otherwise stop it, which is one of the ways a message
  used to go missing entirely.
- **When Android does hide a message, Relay says so in its own words** instead
  of showing you the system's placeholder as though it were the message.

## 1.1.2

- **A message now waits for the glasses instead of being dropped after five
  seconds.** The link to the glasses drops and heals on its own all the time —
  a pocket, a doorway, standby — and healing routinely takes ten to thirty
  seconds. Relay used to give a captured message five seconds to reach the
  glasses and then silently gave up: the message sat in the inbox, and the
  band never came. A message now waits out the reconnection for up to two
  minutes and shows the moment the link is back. Relay also stopped trusting
  a "sent" that never left the phone — a send that dies on a broken
  connection is now retried instead of counted as delivered — and a few
  transient hiccups during registration no longer throw the waiting message
  away. If a message still can't be shown, the log now says exactly what
  blocked it, so field reports can point at the culprit.

## 1.1.1

- **Choose how long messages stay up.** Display time has always scaled with
  the length of the message, which means a two-word text was gone in about
  four seconds — often before your hand reached the touchpad, let alone the
  Reply chip. A new Message display time stepper sets a fixed duration
  instead, from 5 to 45 seconds, applied to every message whatever its
  length. Auto, the default, keeps the scaling behavior unchanged. Reading
  aloud is not affected: while the glasses speak a message the band already
  stays up for the reading, plus the usual answering window after it.

## 1.1.0

- **Read notifications aloud.** A new switch, off by default, has the glasses
  speak a message when it arrives. It reads the newest message whole — not a
  preview, not the first line, because a message cut off halfway sends you back
  to your phone anyway, which is the thing Relay exists to avoid. The band is
  held open while it reads and gives you the usual answering window once it
  stops, so a message is never still being read after its band has gone.
  Answering interrupts the reading, and so does dictating: the glasses stop
  talking the moment they start listening. Needs Rokid Nexus 1.1.5 on the hub;
  the reading is produced on the glasses, so nothing leaves the device and no
  network is involved. Speed and voice come from your Rokid assistant settings.

- **"Sent" lands on the chip you were watching.** Sending used to confirm
  itself above the button while the button went on counting down to a send that
  had already happened. The countdown chip now becomes the confirmation in
  place, and the line above it goes quiet.

## 1.0.2

- **Black out behind notifications.** A new switch, off by default, asks the
  glasses to hide everything else while a Relay notification is up — only the
  notification shows, the way the Even G2 does it. Leaving it off keeps the
  band floating over whatever you were looking at. Needs Nexus 1.1.4 on the
  hub; older hubs simply ignore the request.

- **The test harness can crowd the inbox.** An Eight threads button posts
  eight conversations at once, each from its own sender — one more than the
  glasses list shows at a time, which is exactly the case the inbox needed
  testing against.

## 1.0.1

- Relay has its own mark instead of the shared `chat` icon: two bubbles, the
  message that arrived and the answer going back, with the upper outline
  breaking where the reply crosses in front. The same mark is now the app icon,
  so what you tap in the Store is what you find afterwards.

## 1.0.0

- Initial notification listener, notice, menu-launched inbox, explicit voice
  reply, and local fake notification harness.
