# Building a Rokid Nexus plugin

This is the complete, self-contained contract for writing a Nexus plugin. It is
written to be read by a developer or handed verbatim to a coding agent. Where this
document states a limit or a rule, the hub or SDK enforces it in code — violating it
does not degrade gracefully, it gets your traffic rejected or your process crashed.

Companion documents: [docs/PLUGIN_SDK.md](../docs/PLUGIN_SDK.md) (wire/AIDL
specification), [docs/PLUGINS.md](../docs/PLUGINS.md) (visual design & settings-screen
kit). This file is the contract; those are the deep dives.

## 1. What a plugin is

A Nexus plugin is a **headless phone APK**. It has no launcher icon and no visible
identity outside Rokid Nexus. The Nexus phone hub discovers it, the user approves its
capabilities once, and from then on it is launched from the glasses launcher, renders
on the glasses HUD through the hub, and is configured from a settings screen the hub
opens by explicit component.

Plugins are **normally dormant unless open**: the hub initiates everything. Your process runs
only between `PLUGIN_OPEN` and a final `PLUGIN_CLOSE`. Do not register yourself at boot, do
not poll in the background, do not post notifications. The SDK holds a
foreground-service session while you are open and drops it on close; the
user-facing notification that names the live plugin belongs to the hub. Four
sanctioned exceptions:

1. A capability that Android forces into its own foreground service *while your
   surface is open* (Feeds' overlay WebView host is the precedent) may run that
   service with its own minimal notification — it must start with your surface,
   die with it, and never outlive a close.
2. **Scheduled delivery** (the Assistant's reminders are the precedent): a plugin
   may wake at a moment the wearer *explicitly scheduled through it* — an alarm,
   reminder, or timer they asked for by name — to deliver exactly that item. The
   wake must be an `AlarmManager` broadcast into a short-lived foreground service
   that posts the corresponding notification, optionally raises one notice or pin
   through a one-shot registration, and stops itself within seconds. A boot
   receiver may do nothing beyond rescheduling those same user-created alarms.
   This is not a license to poll, sync, refresh, or run at boot for any other
   reason; "the user would probably want it" does not qualify — only an item the
   user explicitly created with a delivery time does.

3. **Lease-bounded background audio** (SDK 0.18.0, hubs 1.4.10): after
   `onAudioStarted`, `surface.detach()` may close the last ordinary surface while
   retaining the active microphone session and its SDK foreground service.
   `onNexusBackground()` is not a final close; the lease ending is. The phone hub
   exposes Stop, and reopening resumes the plugin. See the lifecycle rules below.
4. **The tile lease**: while the hub reports `onNexusTileActive(true)` (grid
   mode on, glasses linked, tile placed, `widget_tile` granted), a plugin may
   watch its own event sources and publish its tile; a poll-based plugin fetches
   once per `onNexusTileRefresh()`. It schedules no wake or refresh of its own and
   returns to dormant on `onNexusTileActive(false)`. See `docs/PLUGINS.md`.

A phone plugin may also call an Android platform API directly under permissions
declared in its own manifest. Those runtime permissions are separate from Nexus
descriptor capabilities: they do not authorize a bus path, receive prefix, SDK
surface, or glasses resource. Request them in the plugin's settings at the point
of use, explain why they are needed, and surface denial or provider failure
honestly. Assistant's Calendar Provider integration is the precedent. For a
destructive platform action, fail closed on missing or ambiguous identity rather
than guessing; recurring calendar series require explicit whole-series intent.

## 2. Project setup

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts of your own project
// SDK artifacts: bus-client (+ its transitive `shared`) — see docs/PLUGIN_SDK.md
// for the current published coordinate and version.
dependencies { implementation("com.github.Anezium.Rokid-Nexus:bus-client:<version>") }
```

- `applicationId` / namespace: `com.<you>.<something>.plugin.<id>` (first-party
  plugins use `com.anezium.rokidbus.plugin.<id>`).
- `minSdk 30` (Android 11), `targetSdk 36`, `versionName` semver (`1.0.0`).
- Sign every build with **one** certificate. Multi-signer APKs are rejected outright
  (`SIGNER_SET_UNSUPPORTED`). Your signing certificate is part of your identity: the
  user's approval is keyed to `package + pluginId + signerSha256`, so switching from
  a debug key to a release key means uninstall + reinstall + re-approval.

## 3. Manifest contract (the headless rules)

Copy `plugins/sample` as the canonical template. The hard rules:

1. **Exactly one exported service** with an intent filter for action
   `com.anezium.rokidbus.action.PLUGIN`, extending `NexusPluginService`, carrying the
   descriptor `<meta-data>` (plugin id, API version, capabilities, receive prefixes,
   optional settings activity).
2. **No activity with a MAIN/LAUNCHER intent filter.** This is what keeps the plugin
   invisible. The registry CI rejects APKs that violate it.
3. The settings activity (if any) is `exported="true"` **without** any intent filter —
   the hub opens it by explicit component; nothing else can find it.
4. `<queries>` for `com.anezium.rokidbus.action.HUB` (inherited from the bus-client
   AAR manifest, but declare it in your own manifest too for clarity).
5. Foreground-service permissions: `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` +
   `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE`. Do **not** declare `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` — the
   session FGS runs fine with its notification suppressed on Android 13+. The one
   exception is scheduled delivery (§1): a plugin that delivers user-created
   reminders may declare `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, and
   `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, strictly for those deliveries.
6. `REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES` — required for the in-app Uninstall row
   (`NexusUi.uninstallCard`) to open the system uninstall dialog. Without it the
   `ACTION_DELETE` intent is silently rejected.

## 4. Descriptor rules (validated at discovery)

| Rule | Enforced value |
|---|---|
| Plugin id | 3–64 chars, `[a-z][a-z0-9._-]{2,63}` (lowercase start), unique on the device |
| Display name | ≤ 80 chars |
| API version | exactly **3** |
| Capabilities | subset of `surfaces`, `ink_surface`, `http_proxy`, `microphone`, `stt`, `tts`, `camera`, `mediasync`, `assistant`, `wireless_debugging`, `widget_tile` (`ink_surface` is the separate grant for compiled interactive Ink pages; `stt` grants hub-produced text without raw PCM; microphone needs no Android `RECORD_AUDIO` because PCM arrives over the hub; `tts` speaks text out of the glasses; `mediasync` moves the wearer's captures to the phone gallery; `wireless_debugging` can expose ADB on the current LAN and mint temporary pairing codes; `widget_tile` publishes this plugin's closed-state grid HUD tile while the hub's tile lease is active, never from a wake of its own) |
| Optional capabilities | `OPTIONAL_CAPABILITIES`, same values, merged into the requested set; unknown values are ignored rather than rejected, so a hub that does not know a capability (or the key) still loads the plugin. Declare `widget_tile` here. |
| Receive prefixes | non-empty, normalized, within your authorized namespace `/plugin/<id>/…` |
| Signer | exactly one current signing certificate |
| UID | not shared with another discovered plugin |

Any violation makes the plugin an *invalid candidate*: it appears in Plugin access
with the concrete reason visible when Developer details is enabled.

## 5. Lifecycle

```
install → discovery → user approval (Plugin access) → glasses launcher open
  → hub binds service → registration (5 s timeout)
  → PLUGIN_OPEN (ack within 4 s or the hub cold-rebinds once, then gives up)
  → /surface/show or /ink/show → input/action events
  → /surface/hide or /ink/hide (self-close), leased /surface/hide detach,
    or PLUGIN_CLOSE
  → unbind, FGS dropped, back to dormant
```

Facts you must build around:

- **Installation never grants access.** Registration before approval returns
  `PENDING_USER_APPROVAL`. Changing your requested capability set — including
  adding `stt` in an update — resets the grant to Pending, and the user must
  re-approve.
- **Open is re-entrant.** A fresh `PLUGIN_OPEN` re-invokes `onNexusOpen` even if the
  SDK thought you were open: reset your state and re-show. The SDK dedupes the most
  recent 128 lifecycle ids, and callbacks are serialized on the main thread.
- **Hiding your last visible surface, including Ink, is a close.** The hub treats it as self-close,
  delivers `PLUGIN_CLOSE`, and unbinds you. That is the correct way to exit on BACK
  from your root view. The only exception is an ordinary surface's typed
  `detach()` helper while your plugin already holds the ACTIVE microphone lease:
  the hub calls `onNexusBackground`, keeps only that audio session alive, and
  final-closes you as soon as the lease ends. No lease means no background.
  This requires SDK 0.18.0 and hubs 1.4.10 or newer. Give a live microphone pin
  a short TTL renewed by incoming audio, so it expires after a process crash.
- **One plugin owns the HUD at a time.** While another plugin is foreground, your
  `show`/`update` returns `SURFACE_BUSY` — handle it by giving up quietly, never by
  retry-looping. A `show` on an *idle* HUD adopts you as foreground with a real
  `PLUGIN_OPEN`.
- The hub rewrites your local surface id to `pluginId:localSurfaceId` and assigns
  sequence numbers; never hardcode the namespaced form.
- Revocation, binder death, package removal, or link loss close you and hide your
  surfaces. Requests time out after 15 s by default.

## 6. Bus endpoints

Paths a plugin can **send to** (gated by capability):

| Path | Capability | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/surface/show`, `/surface/update`, `/surface/hide` | `surfaces` | HUD surface lifecycle (typed models: card, reader, timed lines, media, image). `NexusSurfaceSession.detach()` marks the last hide as a lease-bounded background-audio request; without the plugin's ACTIVE microphone lease it is an ordinary self-close. A card may carry one `editable` text field; the wearer's answer comes back once on `/surface/text-committed`, delivered to the owner directly (no receive prefix). Gate it on `supportsEditableSurface`, and set `NexusSurfaceSession.onRejected` to hear a `SURFACE_BUSY` that lands after `SENT`. |
| `/ink/show`, `/ink/update`, `/ink/hide` | `ink_surface` | Compiled interactive Ink lifecycle. Use `nexusInkSurfaceSession(id)`; `/ink/event` is the owner-only direct callback path for ready/action/closed/error and needs no receive prefix. |
| `/http/request` → `/http/request/reply` | `http_proxy` | Phone-side HTTP proxy (strict policy, §9) |
| `/audio/lease/acquire`, `/audio/lease/release` (+ `/reply` suffixes), `/audio/frames`, `/audio/lease/revoked` | `microphone` | Glasses mic lease + 16 kHz mono PCM frames. Use the SDK's `nexusAudioSession(callbacks)` rather than these paths directly. |
| `/stt/session/start`, `/stt/session/stop` (+ replies), `/stt/state`, `/stt/partial`, `/stt/final`, `/stt/session/ended` | `stt` | Hub speech-to-text, targeted to the verified session binder. Use `nexusSpeechSession(callbacks)`; never log transcripts. |
| `/tts/speak`, `/tts/stop` | `tts` | Speech out of the glasses. Use `nexusTtsSession(callbacks)`. `/tts/started` and `/tts/done` are **receive-only** — declare exactly those two in RECEIVE_PREFIXES, not `/tts`. Text is capped at 1024 characters, five commands per second, one utterance at a time on the glasses. Voice and speed belong to the wearer's Rokid assistant settings; nothing may change them. |
| `/camera/freeze/result`, `/camera/overlay`, `/camera/link/offer` | `camera` | Camera platform sends (signer/grant-bound). `/camera/link/offer` is bidirectional so an approved camera plugin can advertise a reverse transport role. `/camera/session/state` and `/camera/freeze/image/chunk` remain **receive-only** (declare them in RECEIVE_PREFIXES); sending them is rejected |
| `/mediasync/settings`, `/mediasync/now` | `mediasync` | Photo sync control: partial settings updates (`autoSyncOnCharge`, `deleteAfterSync`; an empty request is a refresh) and a manual "sync now". `/mediasync/status` is **receive-only** (declare it in RECEIVE_PREFIXES); every other `/mediasync/…` path is hub-to-hub and rejected if you send it |
| `/debug/adb/request` → `/debug/adb/reply` | `wireless_debugging` | High-risk wireless ADB control. Actions are `status`, `enable`, `start_pairing`, `cancel_pairing`, and `disable`. Replies are owner-scoped direct replies and need no receive prefix. The phone hub stamps the authenticated plugin id; plugins must not add or trust one themselves. Pairing codes expire after two minutes and must not be persisted or logged; code-bearing windows use `FLAG_SECURE`, and only an explicit user action may copy a sensitive-marked command to the Android clipboard. |
| `/tile/publish` | `widget_tile` | Publish this plugin's closed-state grid HUD tile (`TileSnapshot`). Use `nexusWidgetTileSession(id).publish(snapshot)`. Not foreground-exclusive — every plugin owns its own tile slot, so it never returns `SURFACE_BUSY` — and published while the hub's tile lease is active (`onNexusTileActive`/`onNexusTileRefresh`; see the Background policy's fourth exception in `docs/PLUGINS.md`). The hub stamps the authenticated plugin id server-side and paces publishes per plugin: past its ceiling only the latest snapshot is kept and sent when the budget refills; there is no error reply for that. |
| `/plugin/<yourId>/…` | — | Your private namespace (must match your declared receive prefixes) |

Wireless ADB requires both phone and glasses hubs 1.3.0 or newer and the
validated Rokid Android 12L/API 32 firmware. Do not fall back to arbitrary shell
commands or Settings automation on an unsupported hub or firmware.
Glasses hub 1.4.1 or newer restores the Wi-Fi radio for `enable` and
`start_pairing` when it is off, then waits for a saved network. It never selects
or configures a network, and `disable` must remain scoped to ADB rather than
turning normal Wi-Fi off.

Paths a plugin **receives** (reserved, hub-generated — you never send these):
`/system/plugin/registration`, `/system/plugin/open`, `/system/plugin/close`,
`/system/plugin/input`, `/glasses/device-info`, `/surface/text-committed`, plus
deliveries into your `/plugin/<id>/…` namespace.
Reserved sender roots you can never use: `/launcher`, `/surface/input`, `/ink/event`,
`/core`, `/system`, `/security`, `/error`. Rejections and undeliverable traffic
come back on `/error` as `{code, forId, pluginId}` (hubs before 1.4.6 omitted
`pluginId`, and the SDK dropped those errors unseen). `/core/native-apps/*`, `/core/remote-input/*`,
`/core/navigation/*`, and `/core/pointer/*` are trusted phone-hub/glasses-hub
controls, never plugin APIs.

Every approved, live registration receives glasses hardware signals without an
additional capability grant. `onNexusLinkState` includes
`LinkStateBits.GLASSES_WORN`; `onNexusGlassesAiButton(active)` reports the AI
button start/stop edges; and `/glasses/device-info` reaches `onNexusMessage` with
the versioned `GlassInfo` fields.

Transport is the hub's business: local delivery first, CXR for JSON ≤ 3 KiB,
SPP otherwise. Binary is never queued for a sleeping client — an undeliverable
binary frame is dropped, not retried.

## 7. Enforced limits (the ones that reject or crash)

| Area | Limit |
|---|---|
| Surface JSON payload | 64 KiB (SDK preflight — fails locally) |
| Local surface id | `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}` |
| Ink source/data | page ≤ 32 KiB UTF-8; merged data or update patch ≤ 16 KiB UTF-8; local id uses the surface-id rule |
| Ink render document | ≤ 64 KiB, 256 nodes, depth 32; patch ≤ 64 KiB / 1,024 changes |
| Ink rich components | chart ≤ 4 series and 256 points per series; canvas ≤ 512 commands at ≤ 30 fps; inline Lottie JSON ≤ 32 KiB |
| Card | ≤ 64 rows; title ≤ 120; line/subtitle/footer ≤ 240; **contentKey ≤ 128** (hash long keys!); badge ≤ 24; ≤ 8 trail entries of ≤ 24 |
| Timed lines | ≤ 2 000 entries, non-negative times |
| Image surface | JPEG/PNG ≤ 64 KiB compressed, edges ≤ 512 px, ≤ 512² total px, ≥ 150 ms between updates |
| Mono artwork | 16–192 px per edge (the glasses renderer floor is 16 even though the SDK accepts 1) |
| Tile snapshot | pluginId/contentKey ≤ 128; title/subtitle ≤ 120; badge ≤ 24; unit ≤ 16; progress 0f..1f; ≤ 4 rows of ≤ 120 chars; template texts ≤ 120 except paragraph ≤ 280, summary/detail ≤ 60, summaryShort ≤ 6; ≤ 9 lines; ≤ 3 sections and ≤ 6 list items; staleAfterMs 60 s..24 h; payload ≤ 12 KiB |
| Media artwork (binary) | image rules with 256 px edge cap |
| Local binder binary | 512 KiB per frame |
| SPP frame | 2 MiB body; binary metadata header ≤ 64 KiB |
| Offline JSON queue | 32 messages / 512 KiB / 30 s TTL — binary never queued |
| Request timeout | 15 s default |

Typed-model violations throw `IllegalArgumentException` **in your process** at
construction time (this has crashed real plugins — a `contentKey` built by
concatenating card content blew the 128-char cap on real data; hash instead).

## 8. Rendering rules

### Plugin identity icon

Both icon declarations are optional. Prefer a Nexus built-in by declaring
`com.anezium.rokidbus.plugin.ICON` with one of these keys: `music`, `disc`,
`bus`, `cart`, `lens`, `mic`, `send`, `feed`, `weather`, `chat`, `calendar`,
`clock`, `star`, `heart`, `game`, `globe`, `bell`, `terminal`, `grid`, `map`,
`bolt`, or `bookmark`. A built-in key also renders natively on the glasses
launcher — a custom `ICON_DRAWABLE` cannot reach the glasses (it lives in your
phone APK), so declare a built-in `ICON` too whenever one fits. **Never remove
your `ICON` key to force the custom drawable to show**: the glasses fall back
to the generic grid glyph and your plugin loses its identity there. Declare
both and keep both.

If the built-in set does not fit your identity, declare your own drawable
resource instead:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.anezium.rokidbus.plugin.ICON_DRAWABLE"
    android:resource="@drawable/my_glyph" />
```

The custom drawable must be a monochrome silhouette: use a `VectorDrawable`
with alpha and a single-color shape on transparency. Nexus loads it from your
package and tints it green. A full-color logo loses its colors and renders as a
green blob. If both fields are present and `ICON` is a recognized built-in key,
the built-in wins; otherwise Nexus tries `ICON_DRAWABLE`, then falls back to the
grid glyph.

Your glyph lives in **one file** and feeds every surface: the sample template's
`ic_launcher_foreground.xml` is an `<inset>` (20%) pointing at the same drawable
as `ICON_DRAWABLE`, so the Android app icon (Settings → Apps) and the themed
icon follow automatically. Do not edit `ic_launcher_foreground.xml` — replace
the glyph drawable it references. Registry submissions should also ship a
512×512 `iconAsset` PNG (green glyph on `#030C06`, **centered**, occupying the
central ~60% of the canvas); the Store downloads and shows it via the feed's
`iconUrl`. To **change** that artwork later, submit it under a **new filename**
(and update `iconAsset` accordingly): phones cache store icons by URL for seven
days, so replacing the bytes at the same URL leaves stale icons on devices.

The ordinary surface API renders **structured rows**, not free text: build
`NexusCard` / `NexusReader` / `NexusTimedLines` / `NexusMedia` / image surfaces
and let the glasses lay them out. For an authored layout, use a separately
granted `NexusInkSurfaceSession`: the phone compiles a strict `.ink` subset into
an inert document and the glasses project it to native Views. Ink v1 executes no
JavaScript, fetches no URLs, and exposes only bounded data binding plus action
ids; use the typed SDK instead of hand-building `/ink/*` payloads. An Ink
`image` is currently a placeholder reference because the public session has no
asset transfer; use the ordinary image surface for real pixels.

Never pre-format monospace strings. Input arrives as DPAD-style events
(`/system/plugin/input`): forward/back swipes, tap (ENTER), BACK. BACK at your root
= hide your surface (self-close, §5).

### Ink pages

Declare `ink_surface`, create one session per local surface id, and gate rich UI
on the live renderer bit. `supportsInkSurface` reports Ink v1 plus SPP, while
`show` separately checks the plugin grant. Keep a card fallback for either kind
of failure.

```kotlin
private var ink: NexusInkSurfaceSession? = null

override fun onNexusOpen() {
    ink = nexusInkSurfaceSession("main")
    val shown = nexusClient?.supportsInkSurface == true &&
        ink?.show(
            page = INK_PAGE,
            data = JSONObject().put("value", "72"),
            handlesBack = false,
        ) == NexusSdkResult.SENT
    if (!shown) {
        nexusSurfaceSession("main")?.showCard(NexusCard("Status", listOf("72")))
    }
}

override fun onNexusInkAction(surfaceId: String, actionId: String, dataset: JSONObject) {
    if (surfaceId == "main" && actionId == "refresh") {
        ink?.update(JSONObject().put("value", "73"))
    }
}

override fun onNexusInkError(surfaceId: String, problems: List<NexusInkProblem>) {
    // Surface the typed problems in developer diagnostics; do not retry-loop.
}
```

An SFC contains one JSON `<script def>` with an optional `data` object, one `<page>`, and
an optional `<style>`. `<script setup>` is rejected. V1 supports interpolation,
bounded expressions, `wx:if`/`wx:elif`/`wx:else`, `wx:for`, class-based styles,
`view`, `text`, `scroll-view`, `chart`, `progress`, inline-JSON `lottie-view`,
and declarative `nx-canvas`. A `bindtap="refresh"` or `catchtap="refresh"`
emits that action id; `data-*` attributes become its callback dataset. Updates
are set-data-style patches, so nested keys such as `metrics[0].value` are valid.
The complete example is `plugins/sample` and the full API is in
`docs/PLUGIN_SDK.md`.

## 9. HTTP proxy policy

`/http/request` is deliberately narrow: HTTPS to allowlisted hosts only (currently
`api.transitous.org`), GET/POST only, five permitted request headers, request body
≤ 64 KiB, response budget 4 MiB. It exists for glasses-side fetches; phone-side
plugins with `INTERNET` permission should just use their own network stack. Adding a
host to the allowlist is a hub change — open an issue.

## 10. Debugging your plugin

- **Developer mode** — Nexus app → Settings → Advanced → *Developer mode*. While on:
  sideloaded plugins get a DEV badge, installing a new ungranted plugin raises a
  "New plugin detected" notification that jumps straight to the approval screen, and
  the **Bus inspector** unlocks below the toggle.
- **Bus inspector** (Settings → Advanced → Bus inspector) — a live journal of the
  last 500 bus events, filterable per plugin: registrations (including every
  rejection code), opens/closes, surface and Ink show/update/hide/event, input, transport choice,
  binary drops — rejections show in amber with their reason (`SURFACE_BUSY`,
  `PENDING_USER_APPROVAL`, capability denied, payload too large, …). The journal
  records only while developer mode is on.
- **What the inspector cannot see**: SDK-side preflight failures never reach the hub
  — typed-model `require()`s crash your process at construction time, and the 64 KiB
  surface ceiling / image preflight / offline-queue evictions fail locally. Watch
  your own logcat for those.
- Plugin access → Developer details shows why an invalid candidate was rejected and
  the signer digest the hub sees for your APK.

## 11. Test loop

```
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install -r your-plugin.apk        # grant survives -r (same signer + capabilities)
# phone: Nexus → Plugins → your plugin → approve capabilities (first time only)
# glasses: launcher → your plugin     # binding happens on open, not at boot
```

The phone hub watches package added/changed/removed broadcasts and reconciles
grants, readiness, and the glasses launcher list on its own — no hub restart
needed after (un)installing a plugin. `adb uninstall` revokes the grant (by
design — reinstall means re-approval).

## 12. Publishing

Distribution is F-Droid-like — you host, the registry indexes:

1. Publish the release APK on **your own** GitHub repository's releases.
2. Add `plugins-nexus/<id>.json` to
   [RokidBrew-Registry](https://github.com/Anezium/RokidBrew-Registry) via PR — copy
   `EXAMPLE.template.json`. Required alongside the usual metadata:
   `artifact.sha256`, **`artifact.signerSha256`** (lowercase hex SHA-256 of your
   signing certificate — `apksigner verify --print-certs your.apk`), HTTPS URLs,
   `id == nexus.pluginId`, `apiVersion: 3`, capabilities from the allowlist.
3. CI downloads your APK and verifies everything: hashes, signer, package/version
   metadata, exactly one exported plugin service, no MAIN/LAUNCHER activity. A human
   merges after CI is green.
4. Updates: publish the new APK on your releases, PR the manifest bump. Keep the
   same signing certificate forever — Android and the grant system both pin it.
5. Build **after** you commit and tag, never from a dirty tree. AGP embeds the
   git revision of your checkout in the APK (`META-INF/version-control-info.textproto`),
   and review authenticates the APK against the release tag through it: an APK
   whose recorded revision is not the tagged commit cannot be verified against
   your source and will be held. The correct order is: commit everything
   (version bump included) → tag → build → publish that exact APK.
