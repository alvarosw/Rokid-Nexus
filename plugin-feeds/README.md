# Nexus Feeds plugin

Feeds puts social timelines on the glasses HUD. The source menu on the glasses
offers **Bluesky** and, when the X account is connected, **X (account)** and
**X (WebView)** — availability follows what is configured in the plugin
settings on the phone.

Navigation is three levels deep: the timeline (one post per card), a tap opens
the post's **thread**, and a tap on a post with media opens the **gallery**,
which downloads the actual photo and renders it on the HUD through the binary
image surface (with a text fallback when the image link is unavailable). In
list views, media shows as inline markers: `[photo]`, `[N photos]`, or
`[video M:SS]` with the clip duration — video playback itself is not a HUD
surface.

## Grid tile

With the optional `widget_tile` grant, Feeds publishes a list tile for the
glasses grid in every size from `1x1` to `3x3`: up to six posts from the first
page of one timeline, each with the author, `@handle`, the post text with its
media marker at the end, and its age, under a summary such as
`Bluesky · 8 new` (posts not seen at the previous refresh). Further posts count
as "+N more".

The tile is refresh-driven. While the hub's tile lease holds, Feeds fetches
once when the lease starts and once per `onNexusTileRefresh()` (the hub sends
those when the glasses home comes back into view, and at most every 15
minutes), publishes, and stays idle; it schedules no refresh of its own and
stops at `onNexusTileActive(false)`. The tile reads the default source set in
the settings when that is Bluesky, X (account) or X (official API); X (WebView)
needs its overlay window, which only an open surface may run, so a tile with
that default reads Bluesky instead.

## X (WebView)

`X (WebView)` is an experimental alternative to `X (account)`. Both reuse the
single X login in the plugin settings. The existing account source makes its own
internal API request; the WebView source instead lets `x.com` issue the request
and captures the `HomeTimeline` or `HomeLatestTimeline` GraphQL response through
injected `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` wrappers. A document-start script is used
when the installed Android WebView supports it, with page-start reinjection as a
fallback. It does not read the page DOM.

### One-time setup

1. Open Nexus Feeds settings on the phone and connect the X account.
2. Tap **Grant display-over-apps access** and allow Nexus Feeds to display over
   other apps. This permission is needed for the invisible 1 x 1 WebView window.
3. Select **X (WebView)** and save settings.

While this source is open, a dedicated foreground service (`XWebViewHostService`)
owns the transparent overlay and WebView. Closing the Feeds surface tears down
both. Moving forward at the end of the captured page scrolls the WebView to
trigger X's next network response.

The live WebView, JavaScript execution, overlay, and infinite-scroll path require
on-device testing. JVM tests cover URL matching, interception payload properties,
the shared GraphQL parser path, timeout and missing-session messages, and repeated
response pagination stopping.
